##### [jekyll-multiple-languages 2.0][] is released now.

In the past half year, I was so busy with my work and life that I did not notice that this plugin was broken with Jekyll 3.

Thank [@bobgle][] for reporting this [issue][], but I was still have no time to fix it.

Thanks to the holiday in the past Christmas, I fixed this issue and most of the open issues.

In this release, I've tried to make this plugin simpler and easier to use:

1.  Removed some some useless variables and configurations which are vague, for example:

    `url_no_language`, `no_fill_default_content`, `fill_default_content`

2.  Rewrote the document site and the sample project for this plugin.

    http://jekyll-langs.liaohuqiu.com/

3.  Updated the sample project, make sure it contains all the futures in this plugin.

    Sample project: https://github.com/liaohuqiu/jekyll-multiple-languages-sample/tree/master

    Sample site: http://jekyll-langs-sample.liaohuqiu.com/

Happy coding!
